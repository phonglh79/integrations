- title: process.handle_count
  type: gauge
  description: The total number of handles currently open by this process. This number is equal to the sum of the handles currently open by each thread in this process.
- title: process.id_process
  type: gauge
  description: The unique identifier of this process. ID Process numbers are reused, so they only identify a process for the lifetime of that process.
- title: process.pct_processor_time
  type: gauge
  description: The percentage of elapsed time that all process threads used the processor to execution instructions. Code executed to handle some hardware interrupts and trap conditions are included in this count.
- title: process.private_bytes
  type: gauge
  description: The current size, in bytes, of memory that this process has allocated that cannot be shared with other processes.
- title: process.thread_count
  type: gauge
  description: The number of threads currently active in this process. Every running process has at least one thread.
- title: process.virtual_bytes
  type: gauge
  description: The current size, in bytes, of the virtual address space the process is using. Use of virtual address space does not necessarily imply corresponding use of either disk or main memory pages. Virtual space is finite, and the process can limit its ability to load libraries.
- title: process.working_set
  type: gauge
  description: The current size, in bytes, of the Working Set of this process. The Working Set is the set of memory pages touched recently by the threads in the process. If free memory in the computer is above a threshold, pages are left in the Working Set of a process even if they are not in use. When free memory falls below a threshold, pages are trimmed from Working Sets. If they are needed, they will then be soft-faulted back into the Working Set before leaving main memory.
