### DESCRIPTION

The SignalFx Kong collectd plugin provides users with the ability to gather and report their service traffic
metrics with collectd, in tandem with <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/signalfx/kong-plugin-signalfx">kong-plugin-signalfx</a>.

This plugin emits metrics for configurable request/response lifecycle groups including:

* Counters for response counts
* Counters for cumulative response and request sizes
* Counters for cumulative request, upstream, and Kong latencies

These request/response lifecycle groups can be optionally partitioned by tunable levels of granularity by:

* API or Service Name/ID
* Route ID
* Request HTTP Method
* Response HTTP Status Code

In addition to these groups, system-wide connection stats can be provided, including:

* A counter for total fielded requests
* Gauges for active connections and their various states
* A gauge for database connectivity

### INSTALLATION

Both the SignalFx Smart Agent and collectd agent report metrics made available by the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/signalfx/kong-plugin-signalfx">kong-plugin-signalfx</a> metric endpoint. Please download and install this Lua module on all Kong servers using its <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/signalfx/kong-plugin-signalfx/blob/master/README.md">instructions</a>.

* If you are using the SignalFx Smart Agent, collectd-kong is already included.  Please see <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/blob/master/docs/monitors/collectd-kong.md">the monitor documentation</a> for configuration instructions.

* If you are using the SignalFx collectd agent follow the steps below.

1. Download and install the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-kong/">collectd-kong</a> Python module.

2. Download SignalFxâ€™s <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/blob/master/collectd-kong/10-kong.conf">sample configuration file</a> to `/etc/collectd/managed_config`.

3. Modify the configuration file as described in [Configuration](#configuration) below.

4. Restart collectd.
